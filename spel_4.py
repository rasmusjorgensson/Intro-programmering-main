2. Make the player move with the arrow keys.
3. Make the player stop when it hits a wall. In all directions.
4. Add objects to pick up. Use: chrystal_wall_lightmagenta.png
5. Make the player pick up the object when it collides with it.
6. Make the object disappear when the player picks it up.
7. Add score to the game. Show the score on the screen.
8. When all objects are picked up, show a message on the screen.
9. Add monsters that move around in the maze. 
   Random movement of your choice. Use: ogre_old.png

Extra tasks:
1. Show the doors in the maze.
2. If the player enters a door, the player is teleported to another door.
